##### Ideas for the FIRE Dashboard! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

- Fire Danger Rating for the Day.
- Weather for the Day - refer to the BOM App. - For throughout the day: Temperature, Humidity, Wind speed etc.
- Tweets from RFS and Others.
- page would need to update every 5 minutes or so?
- Some kind of timer - to show the last time the page updated.
- Anything else related to fire?




- potentially could use local memory/storage to hold on to/save the person's location - so that they would only have to state it once and it should use that for everytime post.
