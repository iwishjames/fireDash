**Fire Dash**: Your centralised dashboard for the bushfire season!

I wanted to create this app to develop my skills with React and general coding. I also felt it was an annoyance that I had to have multiple apps to keep up to date on the bushfire events happening around me.

##### Ideas for the FIRE Dashboard! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

- Fire Danger Rating for the Day.
- Weather for the Day - refer to the BOM App. - For throughout the day: Temperature, Humidity, Wind speed etc.
- Tweets from RFS and Others.
- App would have to be mobile first! Given that it is where people are most likely to view it.
- Dark mode option or permanent dark mode...so that it doesn't use up battery life on phones? I think better to give the option, that be fixed - have to think about accessibility for people with difficulty viewing the screen.
- page would need to update every 5 minutes or so?
- Some kind of timer - to show the last time the page updated.
- The notification/email option if the fire thing goes above high - Use the trick we had learnt from class??

- Anything else related to fire?




- potentially could use local memory/storage to hold on to/save the person's location - so that they would only have to state it once and it should use that for everytime the page is reloaded.
